      "\n",
      "### 1. **Cybercriminals breach Aflac as part of hacking spree against US insurance industry - CNN**\n",
      "   - **Importance**: High. The breach highlights critical vulnerabilities in the insurance sector, a significant issue in cybersecurity and technology trends as hackers increasingly target large industries. Implications for data security, consumer trust, and insurance operations are substantial.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Stock futures gain as Fed's Waller sees rate cut ahead, Trump delays Iran strike decision: Live updates - CNBC**\n",
      "   - **Importance**: High. A potential Federal Reserve rate cut could have global economic implications, particularly for tech innovation and investment. The delayed action on Iran also ties into international affairs with economic and geopolitical consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Geofenced With 'Safety Monitor': What The Tesla Robotaxi Launch Will Look Like - Investor's Business Daily**\n",
      "   - **Importance**: High. Tesla advancing self-driving technology is a significant milestone in tech and transportation. The geofencing of robotaxis demonstrates the challenges surrounding autonomous vehicle safety and adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Assisted dying vote: MPs voting after emotional debate - live updates - BBC**\n",
      "   - **Importance**: Medium. Advances in science and medical ethics are core to this debate. The policy decisions could also influence international discussions about end-of-life rights and regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **America’s largest Iranian diaspora is at a crossroads - Politico**\n",
      "   - **Importance**: Medium. This explores demographic and geopolitical dimensions, particularly with regard to U.S.-Iran relations, which have indirect impacts on global tech investments in sectors like energy and communications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Capitol agenda: Rand Paul forces GOP into megabill runaround - Politico**\n",
      "   - **Importance**: Low-Medium. U.S. congressional action, while significant domestically, does not directly impact science, technology, or international relations unless tied to these fields specifically.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Telegram boss Pavel Durov says all his 100-plus kids will get a slice of his $13.9 billion fortune — eventually - Business Insider**\n",
      "   - **Importance**: Low. While notable for the personal life of a tech industry figure, it holds minimal direct value for broader technological or geopolitical significance.\n",
      "\n",
